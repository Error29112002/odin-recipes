    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cozy up with a hot mug of hot chocolate this winter. This old-fashioned hot chocolate recipe is incredibly rich, creamy, and oh-so satisfying.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        These are the simple ingredients you'll need to make the best hot chocolate of your entire life:
        <br>
        <br>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Sugar and cocoa powder:</strong> This sweet and creamy hot cocoa starts with white sugar and unsweetened cocoa powder.</li>
    <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the chocolatey flavor, but it won't make your hot cocoa taste salty.</li>
    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Pour boiling water over the sugar, cocoa powder, and salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Milk:</strong> You can use whole, 2 percent, or the alternative milk of your choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> A dash of vanilla takes the decadent flavor over the top.</li>
    <li><strong>Half-and-half:</strong> Half-and-half is added after the hot chocolate is poured into the mugs, creating a rich texture and cooling the cocoa to a drinkable temperature.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
        <li> Put the dry ingredients in a pan, then whisk in the boiling water.</li>
        <li> Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring constantly, for two minutes.</li>
        <li> Stir in the milk, remove from the heat, and stir in the vanilla.</li>
        <li> Pour the hot cocoa into mugs and finish with half-and-half.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
