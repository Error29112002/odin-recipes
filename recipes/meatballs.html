    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
    <li>½ cup bread crumbs</li>
    <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry French onion soup mix</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 medium onions, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>⅓ cup red wine</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups beef broth</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>6 ounces Gruyère cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine ground chicken, bread crumbs, onion soup mix, egg, and garlic in a medium bowl until well incorporated; form into sixteen 1 1/2-inch meatballs.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and sugar; cook until onions are softened, about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add meatballs; cook, flipping occasionally, until edges are browned, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer skillet to the preheated oven; bake meatballs until no longer pink in centers, about 15 minutes. Check meatballs halfway through; flip if they are browning too much on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Stir red wine, salt, and black pepper into onions; cook over medium heat for 3 minutes. Stir in beef broth and thyme; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; slowly stir in flour. Cook until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Remove meatballs from the oven; pour onion sauce over top. Cover with Gruyère cheese; return skillet to the oven until melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
